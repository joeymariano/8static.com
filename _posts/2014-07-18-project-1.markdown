bio: Chipocrite, a.k.a. Paul Weinstein, uses original Nintendo Game Boys, often accompanied by bass, guitar, drums and/or other lo-fi sequencers, to create complex audio masterpieces. His multifaceted but catchy compositions combine the game sounds of his childhood with modern music influences. Once an 8static mainstay (and a former member of the production team), heâ€™s excited to return to the stage following a five-year break in performing!
